##Trading APIs

A trading API, allows traders to interact with a trading system. They can get prices, volumes, order book etc. They can even directly execute orders. This is particularly useful for traders who run algorithmic models on their trading systems. Most leading crypto exchanges, such as Bitfinex, Bittrex, Coinbase etc. offer trading APIs.
