# Altcoins Concept

The first and most popular crypto coin is **Bitcoin**. All another coins created after this are known like alternative coins or just **“altcoins”**. In nowadays we have a thousands of altcoins and nobody knows their exact count. The most popular altcoins are Ethereum, DASH, Monero etc.  
Some of the crypto currencies are newly created coins, and some of them are forks of already existing ones. For example, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash are forks of the Bitcoin, and EtherZero is fork of Ethereum.

Some of these crypto currencies are accepted for trading on different trading platforms or exchanges and traders can make deals with them. Others are not listed for trading on the exchanges. The reasons are on the one hand, because markets do not consider them to be meaningful enough. On the other hand, the creators of a new cripto currencyes have to pay a lot of money on the exchanges to accept their coins for trade.

## Cryptocurrency Exchanges

If someone wants to own cripto currencies he have to buy them from somewhere \(unless he's a crypto miner\). There are two options:

* Platforms for buing/selling bitcoins/altcoins for fiat money. For example: Coinbase and Bitpanda.

* Exchanges for trading like Bittrex and Kraken. A crypto exchange is a digital marketplace where traders can buy and sell crypto coins using different fiat currencies, bitcoins or alt coins. The traders can exchange crypto currencies like any other exchange-traded asset with online platform that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers.
